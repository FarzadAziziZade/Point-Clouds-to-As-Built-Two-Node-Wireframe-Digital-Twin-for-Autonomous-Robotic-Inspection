# Point-Clouds-to-As-Built-Two-Node-Wireframe-Digital-Twin-for-Autonomous-Robotic-Inspection
- This repository provides an open-source framework for the autonomous inspection of wooden structures. 
- The goal is to assist in the efficient and non-invasive identification of potential issues.

This repository is constantly updated.

* 2/10/2025
